/*
 * ðŸ¥¥ðŸŒ´ EXECUTOR ðŸ¥¥ðŸŒ´
 *
 * 1. Pipes and Redirections (more in exec_redirs.c)
 * An fd which is not STDIN nor STDOUT will be closed as soon as it's not needed
 * - if there are redirections, the pipe's writing end is closed
 * - if there are multiple redirections, the previous file is closed before the
 *   next is opened
 * - in this way, no matter how many redirections and/or pipes there might be,
 *	 the fd never goes above 5
 * - if something happens we're out with exit_code 1
 *
 * 2. If there's no command, we're out with exit_code 0
 * 
 * 3. If it's a built-in function and a single instruction, the command is ran
 * in the minishell process. The exit code is updated with what the command
 * returns and that is returned to the main.
 *
 * 4. Executing in a Child Process
 * We need to create a child process, which will execute the command. In the
 * parent process, we wait for all the child processes to execute and return the
 * right exit code.
 * - a command needs to start executing before the previous one is finished
 *	 for e.g: sleep 5 | ls -> result of ls is printed before sleep finishes
 * - once a command finishes execution, we need to close the writing end of the
 *	 pipe, else if the following command expects input (such as cat or bc) it
 *	 will keep on waiting forever
 * - we need to return the exit code from the last command in the line, not the
 *	 latest to finish execution. for e.g: sleep 5 | las -> returns 127 as las
 *	 does not exist, even though sleep 5 finishes executing later. For that we
 *	 wait and store the exit codes in order.
 *
 * Error Handling
 * - if pipe returns an error, we exit
 * - if open function returns an error, we display message and go to next command
 *	 as it might be because the file doesn't exist (pretty common user error)
