Meet our simple version of a shell.

## üç¥ Parsing
Analyse the text and divide it into categories and sub-categories. 
We went with a linear parsing since we are only dealing with pipes and redirections as operators. The parsing would need to be more abstract if we were dealing with `&&` or `||`, for example.

**Special characters that will need to be handled:**
> `|` pipe <br>
> `<` `<<` `>` `>>` redirections <br>
> `$` environement variable <br>
> `'` `''` quotes <br>
> `alphanumerical` text / commands / flags <br>

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Quotes (`'` `''`) ‚ö†Ô∏è
Quotes are handled from the beginning and all throughout the the process. A boolean like function allows to know if we are at the beginning, the end or in the middle of a quote and will allow the stage we're at to treat that information accordingly. 

### Step 0. Instructions (`|`)
We split the input line into an array** of instructions with pipes as the delimiter.

### Step 1. Translate (`$`)
Then we replace the environement variables (`$HOME`, `$CMD`, `$PWD`...) by they real value (`home/cocoshells`, `ls -l`, `home/cocoshells/minishell`...). We do this when we handle redirections and in the lexer separately because of a few exceptions in the `<<` redirection. <br>
**Careful**: if the environement variable is in between single quotes, it shouldn't be translated.

### Step 2. Redirections (`>` `<` `<<` `>>`)
The redirection operator type and the following argument are saved as redirections (in a dedicated struct). The instruction line is then rewritten without the redirections text.

### Step 3. Lexer (`tokenise`)
All words left are then separated into single elements (in little boxes let's say) using spaces as delimiters.

### Step 4. Parse (`grammar`)
The parsing stage gives the tokens their type : `command`, `flag` or `word` while handling a few exceptions and, more importantly, removing the closed quotes. Then it assigns those tokens to their rightful variable. 

### Step 5. Validation (`semantics`)
We validate and verify the meaning of the result given by the parser. 
<i>That a given name IS a name `David` and not a name that doesn't exist `Philosopher`.</i>

## üåç Environment Variables
In order to make it easier for us to manipulate (as in, delete, add new ones, update...) our environment variables, a linked list is created at the beginning of our programme, where all environment variables are stored.

</br>

## üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Executor
### 1. Opening the Pipe
While looping over each command, I start by opening a pipe, if needed.
In our command struct, we keep track of the file descriptor from which input will be read (fd_in) and the one on which the output will be written (fd_out).
So as I open the pipe, I update the command's fd_out to the pipe's writting end, and the next command's fd_in to the pipe's reading end.

### 2. Redirections and Here docs
The second step is to take care of redirections.
I make sure to close any file descriptor in use before opening another one.
In this way, no matter how many pipes nor how many redirections we have, the number of file descriptors in use never goes beyond 5.
As we go through each redirection, each file is opened (and created if it doesn't exist and we're dealing with an output redirection), and then closed when it's no longer needed.

We deal with here docs by creating a temporary file, where the user input is written until the delimiter is given.
What is the best strategy to create a temporary file?
There are two potential problems to take into consideration: if someone creates a file with the same name and in the same directory as the temporary file, things will go wrong; if the temporary file has always the same name, and a here doc is being processed in two different minishells launched simultaneously, something will go wrong.
To deal with this, I created the temporary file inside the /tmp folder (where users usually don't go) and named it after the tty where the minishell is being launched from.
Environment variables are expanded, unless the delimiter is in between quotes.

### 3. Executing in a child process
If we are looking at a single command which is a built-in, we run it in the parent process.
Else, we create a child process.

As we create a new process with fork, we store all the child PIDs in an array - this will be useful later on.
Inside the child process, we either run the built-in command and exit with what it returns, or we call execve, which will replace our child process for a new one where the command will be run.
Before we do that, we need to do some changes to the files descriptor's table.
We need to copy the file descriptor 0 and make it point, not to STDIN, but to where our fd_in points, using dup2.
In this way, when the new process looks for information from fd 0, it will get the correct information.
Simillarly, we need to copy the file descriptor 1 and make it point, not to STDOUT, but to where our fd_out points.

Then, we need to build the necessary parameters for execve.
We need to find the absolute path to the command, with the help of PATH and access function.
After preparing the arguments and envp for execve, we are ready to run it.

### 4. Waiting and exit codes
Back to the parent process, we wait for each command to finish in the order they were called, so that we store the correct exit code from each command.
Remember the array of PIDs?
This is where they come in handy.
Waiting in order is important to make sure we're returning the exit code from the last command to be called, and not from the last command to finish executing.
In this way, even though the commands are called in a some-what "assynchronous" manner (meaning, we don't wait for the first one to finish before we call the second), we receive their exit status in a some-what "synchronous" manner.
And how do we get the exit codes from the process created by execve?
Using the macros WIFEXITED and WEXITSTATUS, with the status given by waitpid.

## üå± Built-in commands
Gon√ßalo documented well what needs to be taken into consideration for the differente built-in functions, so check [his ReadMe](https://github.com/DimitriDaSilva/42_minishell/blob/master/README.md#51-builtin-functions) and test in bash.

</br>

## üö® Signals
Signals are handled in a different way whether there's a child process running or not.
For that reason, we call a function to reset how signals are handled right before the child process is created and right after it finishes.

</br>

## üß™ Testing and our Non-interactive mode
At the beginning, we thought (I'm still not sure how or why) that we were supposed to make our minishell work both in interactive and non-interactive mode.
The interactive mode being what you actually need to do, running minishell to open a shell and run commands in there; the non-interactive mode being passing a shell script to minishell, which would then execute it line by line.
The non-interactive mode is NOT necessary.

However, it came in handy for testing purposes.
You can find a summary of some [edge cases we found here](https://github.com/Knulpinette/42_03_minishell/blob/master/tester/tests/coco_edge_cases), and a [preparation for the evaluation here](https://github.com/Knulpinette/42_03_minishell/blob/master/tester/tests/coco_eval).
