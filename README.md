## üç¥ Parsing
Analyse the text and divide it into categories and sub-categories. 
We went with a linear parsing since we are only dealing with pipes and redirections as operators. The parsing would need to be more abstract if we were dealing with `&&` or `||`, for example.

**Special characters that will need to be handled:**
> `|` pipe <br>
> `<` `<<` `>` `>>` redirections <br>
> `$` environement variable <br>
> `'` `''` quotes <br>
> `alphanumerical` text / commands / flags <br>

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Quotes (`'` `''`) ‚ö†Ô∏è
Quotes are handled from the beginning and all throughout the the process. A boolean like function allows to know if we are at the beginning, the end or in the middle of a quote and will allow the stage we're at to treat that information accordingly. 

### Step 0. Instructions (`|`)
We split the input line into an array** of instructions with pipes as the delimiter.

### Step 1. Translate (`$`)
Then we replace the environement variables (`$HOME`, `$CMD`, `$PWD`...) by they real value (`home/cocoshells`, `ls -l`, `home/cocoshells/minishell`...). We do this when we handle redirections and in the lexer separately because of a few exceptions in the `<<` redirection. <br>
**Careful**: if the environement variable is in between single quotes, it shouldn't be translated.

### Step 2. Redirections (`>` `<` `<<` `>>`)
The redirection operator type and the following argument are saved as redirections (in a dedicated struct). The instruction line is then rewritten without the redirections text.

### Step 3. Lexer (`tokenise`)
All words left are then separated into single elements (in little boxes let's say) using spaces as delimiters.

### Step 4. Parse (`grammar`)
The parsing stage gives the tokens their type : `command`, `flag` or `word` while handling a few exceptions and, more importantly, removing the closed quotes. Then it assigns those tokens to their rightful variable. 

### Step 5. Validation (`semantics`)
We validate and verify the meaning of the result given by the parser. 
<i>That a given name IS a name `David` and not a name that doesn't exist `Philosopher`.</i>

## üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Executor

I shall write nice things about our executor. For now, here's a note on why I think valgrind doesn't like my cd: https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=112201
